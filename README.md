Intro
This project is a shared mindfulness calendar where the user inputs anything important to do or remember on their calendar. 
Instructions
A user would have to log in in order to load anything they saved on their account / access anything shared with them such as another shared calendar from another user. A user is also able to label each event/reminder with a color as well for an essay visual reminder. 

Said user has the capabilities of sharing their calendar in two options:
Option 1) The user can click on ‘Share This Calendar’ which will copy the URL to their clipboard.
